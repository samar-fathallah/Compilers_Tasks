# Compilers_Tasks
Implementing multiple compiler functions using Java

A compiler is a software system which translates programs in a
source language S into equivalent programs in a target language
T.
If T is the machine language of some machine M, then an hS; Ti
compiler makes S-programs meaningful for M.
